###Description

A call to `helm-make` will give you a `helm` selection of this directory
Makefile's targets. Selecting a target will call `compile` on it.
You can cancel as usual with `C-g`.

###Install

Just get it from MELPA. The single function `helm-make` is auto-loaded, so
no additional setup is required.
